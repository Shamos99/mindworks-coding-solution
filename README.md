# This is the solution to the Mindworks assessments

* The solution to the [Frontend](https://github.com/mindworksint/interview-frontend) problem is in the FrontEnd directory
* The solution to the [GraphQl](https://github.com/mindworksint/interview-graphql-api) problem is in the GraphQL directory
* To run the GraphQL server, run `npm api.js` in the GraphQL directory
* To run the FrontEnd, run `npm install` in the FrontEnd directory followed by `ng serve`
* Note that you need the GraphQL server running before starting the FrontEnd, as that is what is used for the api calls
